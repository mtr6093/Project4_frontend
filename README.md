# The Equipment Maintenance Tracking App

This project is to assit in tracking maintenance records for farm equipment. Currently this app will track the engine hours when engine oil/filter, hydraulic filter, and fuel filter are changed.

## How This App Works

Navigate to the link listed in this section. The application will load a home page where a user can navigate to an equipment list. Once on the list page the user can add a piece of equipment to track or select a currently listed piece of equipment. When a currently entered piece of equipment is selected the page will change to a details page showing the engine hours at last service will be shown for engine oil/filter, hydraulic filter, and fuel filter. On the details each of the previously listed items can have the hours changed as well as remove a piece of equipment from the list.

### Links and Software Installations 

Link to the frontend application:

This application does not require any software be installed on your device (phone, tablet, or computer); the entire application is hosted on a webserver.

## Why This Application?
This application was built as a final project for a General Assembly SEI class. The entire application, frontend and backend, was developed in one week. I chose to create this application because it fills a need for a family memeber's farming opperation.



### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
